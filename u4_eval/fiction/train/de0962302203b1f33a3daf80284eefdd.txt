Lookit it ! !
You can do anything with these dumb fucks if you know how .
Goddamn it .
The snow came a little faster now , he noted .
He thought of her , the first one .
That's what he said .
It was that prick Coughlin .
I'm no hero .
From somewhere in the hut came Coughlin's voice .
It made no sense to him .
He saw himself before them delivering the speech .
His eyes blinked hard , snapping on and squashing some bad things that were trying to push their way into him .
She was a juicy one .
Plenty of room there now .
He knew he couldn't .
He would ! !
So you're not tryin , Johnson , you bastard you .
A tune began to whirl inside his head .
Remember that He heard himself haranguing them .
Anything .
Not captured , sent here .
Oh , sweet land of heaven , haint there just nothin like sweet nigger pussy ! !
`` Lookit that come down , willya '' , said the man , scratching himself , yawning .
The snow was tumbling down furiously now .
I hear the whole bunch is croakin out in the snow .
Prickly twinges of annoyance ran through him .
He was sitting on top of a log which was spinning round and around in the water .
The log was spinning .
`` Don't Christsake me , buddy ! !
A voice pleaded .
Before him , mutilated , bleeding to death , they lay .
There was a hell of a noise this time of morning .
But the words were forming .
The music arrived , taking him its rhythm .
Fuck them .
The man shrank before the hot fury , searching frantically for the answer .
Who did ? ?
He was tingling within .
Normal , by God .
Look at thum .
Oh how they bounced ! !
He felt good .
Am I dreamin ? ?
Jesus , the guy says he is trying .
The music drove them off , or away , and he was free to walk on air in a very few moments , humming and jiving within , beating the rhythm within .
All he does is to bullshit with his squad , and they are the stupidest bastards around .
But he soon saw which way the ball was bouncing .
The waves breakin in on you and your girl at night there on the warm beach in the moonlight .
Maybe they'll stop it now , once for all .
Cover the whole building , bury us all , by nightfall .
Hired , hard lackeys of the Warmongering capitalists .
He had caught her coming out of the shack .
The snow again .
That's how it should be .
It is plain as hell Johnson is no reactionary .
If I hafta do this to stay alive by God I'll do it .
But a nigger .
Did I start the damn war ? ?
He thought of Joe Harris , the nigger who had gone after his sister .
How ? ?
`` I told him '' , he said aloud They'll get the guys that done it .
What the hell was he up to now ? ?
Finnegan woke up .
That'll put the place back to normal .
One day , Ching had told him ( smiling , patting him on the back ) as they walked to the weekly conference of squad leaders , `` Keep it up , your squad is good , one of the best , keep it up , keep up the good work '' .
A river , wide as the Missouri , where it ran by his place .
''
Yooee , we fixed him ! !
That was all .
So what ? ?
Rivers of cold sweat were suddenly unleashed within him .
It always came on , faithfully , just like a radio or juke box , whenever he started to worry too much about something , when the bad things tried to push their way into him .
Top dog , sleeping and eating right there with the Staff .
Capitalism rots from the core .
Less bull the more you can do with em .
He braced himself .
For Christ's sake ! !
Huge glob-flakes hitting the ground , piling higher and higher .
Sonuvabitch , I can't figure out what in hell for they went and put niggers in my squad for .
It came up again and again in the discussion sessions .
I was the first to get my squad on the ball , and anybody thinkin it was easy is pretty damn dumb .
`` Really something '' , he said , aloud .
`` Four cuts at least '' , he chuckled to himself , `` and I owe it all to them '' .
They'd cut their mothers' belly open .
-- name William Foster's Four Internal Contradictions in Capitalism .
He laughed , suddenly , feeling a surge of power telling him of his hold over them , seeing himself before them , receiving utmost respect and attention .
Jesus , imagine , the crummy bastards , they'll get em , they'll get what's comin to em .
He thought of sweet wet nigger pussy .
Lousy Reactionary bastards been tryin to fuck up the Program for months .
Now he heard it , fully ; ;
No doubt it had to do with the log .
Give um the works .
He is good .
`` Yehhh '' , said Coughlin , practically spitting on him .
Why should he be concerned ? ?
Sleepy-eyed , soft-spoken Johnson , Biggest thorn in my side of the whole fucken squad .
The word also made him feel hate , sincere hate , for those so labeled .
That goddamn redheader was the worst .
If the crummy bastard could write ! !
Months .
The guy with most on the Ball .
Like a particle drawn to a magnet he returned to that which was pressing so hard in his mind .
You guys remember that .
`` For Christ's sake '' ! !
He used it very effectively when he wanted to get his squad on the ball .
Somebody'll hafta start thinkin .
`` You , Listen ! !
He turned to the window again .
Maybe it's a good thing it happened .
He whirled around , suddenly hot all over , finding the man who had been standing before him a few moments back , nailing him to the spot on which he now stood , open-mouthed .
All those dumb 8-Balls croaked .
Kaboom for .
Dirty Reactionary bastards comin down here in the night and bumpin off ol Slater and those other poor bastards .
He rolled over and tried to shut out the noise , now much louder .
When I talked to Ching about it , he said , Everyone can learn , if he is not a Reactionary or lazy .
But it didn't .
Did I start the damn war ? ?
`` Yehhh '' , said Coughlin , testily , eyeing him up and down .
Automatically , Finnegan started going over today's lesson .
Keep the chatter to a minimum , short answers , one word , if possible .
The thought came back , the one nagging at him these past four days .
Am I nuts ? ?
Knows the score With a supreme effort , he broke it off .
Just about to get their asses kicked into hut Seven .
Why Slater ? ?
He stared out the window .
Brandon dreamed .
Then he was asking himself the usual early morning questions : What the Hell am I doin here ? ?
( he asked this out loud , but no one heard it over the other noise in the hut ) .
Somebody , got to be somebody If I don't put my two cents in soon , somebody else will I know they're waitin only for one thing : for the bastards what done it to be nailed .
To fuck up the program .
the final word came forth .
Why should I be spinning just because the goddamn log is spinning ? ?
Turn the bastards over to me -- to me and my boys -- no nigger ever got what would be comin to them -- reactionary bastards .
But he isn't with it , not at all with it .
`` How long did you study ? ?
He ain't so bad .
He chuckled , the memory vivid .
Just answer .
Krist , I wish they could write ! !
That's Brown's trouble .
'' His arm moved swiftly , violently , once , twice .
How did they miss him when they got Slater ? ?
All pricks like Coughlin run it anyway , one way or another .
Just let me go home to Jersey , back to the shore , oh , Jesus , the shore .
He was trembling , a strange feeling upon him , fully expecting some catastrophe to strike him dead on the spot .
No one is stupid .
Somebody was up .
How long , buddy '' ? ?
Why me ? ?
Poor ol Slater .
Stroked him , snaked all through him , the lyrics lifted him , took him from one magic isle to another , stopping briefly at each Brandon .
He had been pretty scared himself , wondering what the hell was coming off .
It was nothing , though his heart was thumping wildly .
But I told him , goddammit .
`` Bastards '' , he said aloud , spitting on them .
Is this a nut-house ? ?
Over on the bank , the west bank , a man stood , calling to him .
Soon came back to his senses .
I hated the goddamn army from the first day I got in anyhow .
He couldn't make out what he was saying .
It was a word he was proud of , a word that meant much to him , and he used it with great pleasure , almost as if it were an exclusive possession , and more : he sensed himself to be very highly educated , four cuts above any of the folks back home .
Fresh , warm , sweet and juicy , sweet lovin sixteen , she was .
He watched the snow once again .
`` bout takin his place '' He listened , waited , nothing happened .
He fought it , seeking to kill the last few words , but on they came out .
I bet .
He had never heard the word reactionary before his life as a POW began .
Who is the man to take His place ? ?
He felt intense satisfaction .
They're doin it now .
That's a good one .
I'll bet both together did .
He oughta know .
He looked over at him , lying there , asleep , and he felt a wave of revulsion .
The man moved away .
Thoroughly Wised up .
Man , how I love nigger pussy ! !
Clean the place up .
He glowed with anticipation about what would happen to the culprits when they caught them .
C'mon -- 'mon ! !
His old self .
Quick -- Quick -- now '' ! !
Damn good .
Goddamn .
He halted , and looked around .
But he was not .
Johnson .
Most on the ball .
It's those two fucken niggers ! !
One of his favorites : `` Guitar Boogie '' .
How he loathed him .
`` They'll get them by God and let them bring them down here to me , just let them , God , I'll slice their balls right off .
His thoughts turned to other things .
He was the guy what always goofed at Question Time .
Only one worth a shit , and that's Brandon .
I thought I knew .
He looked for the source of the noise that had awakened him .
Jee-sus , We Fixed him ! !
So fuck them both .
And he took heart ; ;
He snuggled into the blanket .
It was as if it had been done .
They'll get the guys that done it .
`` Boy , you're stirrin early '' , a sleepy voice said .
He tried to stifle it .
Why don't Uncle Sam mind his own fucken business ? ?
Coughlin grinned , feeling supremely on top of things .
The music surged up , but it failed to check it .
Jesus ! !
He was again tingling with pleasure , seeing himself clearly in Slater's shoes .
Goddammit .
Top dog .
Why didn't the damn Reactionaries bump him off ? ?
That was really something , coming from Ching .
Goddamn niggers , Lord .
A gnawing and gnashing within him .
Ching , Tien , all of them .
It infuriated him .
Nigger pussy .
The whole fucken sky's cavin in ! !
That's the way .
The big shock everybody had when they found ol Slater and those others done for .
Keerist .
Why didn't he drop dead ? ?
Why couldn't they have dumped him off on someone else ? ?
There was something troubling him though : as yet they hadn't Five days .
The whole fucken sky's caved in ! !
What I have to put up with ! !
Keeeerist ! !
If only the fucken weather wasn't so lousy ! !
Maybe they already got them .
They'll toe the line .
He stared at it , amazed , alarmed .
Is this for real ? ?
Handle men .
See , he's already snapping it up , the dumb jerk .
`` I soon came back to my senses '' , he said , aloud , to the young blizzard , proudly , drawing himself up , as if making a report to some important superior .
He kept sayin , not me , not me , I don't wanta wind up like em .
He whirled about suddenly .
