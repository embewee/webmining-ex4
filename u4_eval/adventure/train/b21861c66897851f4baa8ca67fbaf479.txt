There isn't much time .
`` I'll go , Clay '' .
He turned to Lester .
Purvis and Silas Pettigrew were the last to leave .
They passed ranches that were framed dark gray against the black hills .
My men , they all left me .
They neither gained nor fell back .
He looked over his shoulder at the thin dotting of pursuers .
`` Come here '' .
He treats her like she was dirt .
They just all cleared out .
The old man beckoned with one finger and Clayton went forward to him .
I'll saddle the horses and bring them round .
Can't let you go way from me again '' He closed his eyes , ashamed of his tears .
And you stand by like a fool and let him do it ''
he could feel more than hear the staccato beat of hoofs that fanned out across the prairie to the north .
And you wanted no part of me when I had so much to give .
I made you a man '' .
They mounted up and rode slowly behind the others at a safe distance .
`` Lived alone here for three years , before any man came .
Just a half-breed 'pache , never said much , never meant anythin to me , but he stuck with me .
Clayton is with him , takin him out of the valley .
If we let them go , they won't stay away , they'll find men to ride with them and they'll be back .
He got into a fight with Tom English , your brother's son .
A man could make a mark there .
The mare had backed away .
Oh ! !
He would never reach California .
He rode low on the mare's neck .
You see , he lied to us when he said he was leavin alone '' .
With every leaping stride of the horse beneath him he crossed one more patch of earth that had been his , that he would never see again .
Gavin sighed bitterly .
`` California '' .
You take it easy , your time will come '' .
`` They'll trample it down .
`` You take it easy , boy '' , Clayton whispered .
In vain his mind groped to reassemble the bones of the relationships he had sought so desperately , but they would not come to life .
`` You can't stay here with me .
Joe Purvis was thinking back many years .
Beneath his black shirt his frail shoulders shook and croaks of pain broke from his throat , the stored pain shattering free in slow gasps , terrible to see .
The boy jerked away .
`` You're Gavin's son '' , Joe Purvis had said .
The land over which he sped was the land he had created and lived in : his valley .
I have to think about it .
Clayton looped the reins in a knot over the veranda post and patted the warm flesh of his neck .
`` You brought him back to this valley thinkin he would help you find your boy .
`` You don't hate me any more '' ? ?
Cabot turned back to the men and he was drunk with the thing they would do , wild to break from the cloying warmth of the saloon into the cold of the ebbing night .
Clayton swung into the saddle and whacked the stallion's rump .
`` Yes , Gavin , you did '' .
It was the only thing in his life for which he felt guilt .
Now there's nothin left of me .
He remembered Gavin's smirk , his own cringing feeling , his impotence .
The stallion had smelled the mare coming into heat and began to paw the turf , shaking his head .
Dawn would come soon and the night was at its coldest .
`` The horses .
The moon had sunk below the black crest of the mountains and the land , seen through eyes that had grown accustomed to the absence of light , looked primeval , as if no man had ever trespassed before .
`` That's a new land .
Lived alone by the river .
The men in Pettigrew's were tired from a night's drinking , their faces red and baggy .
They greeted the news angrily , as though they had been cheated of purpose .
`` Do you mean '' -- he asked almost shyly -- `` you want me to go with you , wherever you're goin '' ? ?
`` He stuck with me all these years .
`` Keep out of this '' , Purvis snarled .
`` Do you remember Big Charlie '' ? ?
Now they were riding to kill him .
Gavin began to nod .
He did not look back ; ;
Ahead of him Gavin turned slightly off the trail and pointed for the Gap , no more than a mile away .
And he was fleeing , running -- fleeing his death and his life at the same time .
I believed him .
He worked his tongue round and round in the hollow of his cheek and his voice came out of his throat , dry and cracked .
The wind of their running was cold and wild , the horses were lathered and their manes streamed like stiff black pennants in the wind .
Gavin's lips moved so that Clayton had to stoop to catch the words .
There's only one way they can get out now and that's through the Gap -- if we ride hard we can take them '' .
He wouldn't even dance with her at Gavin's party .
In that inert landscape the caravan of his desires passed before his mind .
`` It will grow again -- in California '' .
Clayton freed himself from the embrace and stepped back .
But California is where we're goin '' .
I saw you driftin away -- but I tried .
It was nice then , so peaceful and quiet .
He approached the horse and laid a hand on the stallion's quivering neck .
`` To a ranch in the valley .
Gavin's stallion was in the barn and he tightened the cinches over the saddle blanket , working by touch in the darkness , comforting the animal with easy words .
They killed Big Charlie , dumped his body in my rose garden two nights ago .
He was thinking of Rittenhouse and how he had left him there , to rock to death on the porch of the Splendide .
in the cold dawn the mist swirled low to the ground , then rose with a gust of sudden wind to leave the valley clear .
I didn't understand why , Clay .
Gavin stood on the porch , a thin figure .
He remembered Clayton's mocking smile in the saloon when he had asked him what he would do if they brought their cattle to water .
Thirty-six
When he had finished he led him and the mare to the porch .
The two men whipped their horses into town and flung themselves up the steps of the saloon , crying their intelligence .
He meant to help Gavin all the time .
He saw them ambushed , strewn in the postures of the broken and the dying .
Clayton choked , shook his head , murmuring , `` No '' .
You get ready ''
`` She doesn't want you now .
That would mock me too much ! !
It was the night Clayton had tricked them in the poker game .
There are plenty of fresh horses halfway at my place .
God in Heaven , I can't refuse you now .
against this bent man in the chair he was powerless .
Then he thought of a time when Clayton's horse had fallen lame in the Gap .
`` I made you what you are '' , Gavin whispered .
They had been seen as soon as they left the ranch , picked out of the darkness by the weary though watchful eyes of two men posted a few hundred yards away in the windless shelter of the trees .
`` Yes '' .
Then at last the darkness began to dissolve .
`` He's leavin .
Just cleared out .
Gavin sank down again into his chair and began to rock .
`` I hate to leave my garden '' , Gavin said .
`` All my life '' , he said , `` I tried .
`` Yes , like a father and son '' .
But the liquor had flushed their courage .
Gavin slipped his arms around his chest and hugged him fiercely .
The Gap looming before him -- the place where had confronted Jack English on that day so many years ago -- was his exit from all that had meaning to him .
I tried .
`` I made you so you could stand up .
Clayton called to him and he came slowly down the steps .
Laurel is gone , my men are gone , Ed is dead -- and you come to me , to help me .
The clouds parted and hard gashes of sunlight swooped down to stain the earth with streaks of white and gold light so that the shadows of the running horses flowed like dark streams over the dazzling snow .
It looked as Gavin had first seen it years ago , on those nights when he slept alone by his campfire and waked suddenly to the hoot of an owl or the rustle of a blade of grass in the moon's wind -- a savage land , untenanted and brooding , too strong to be broken by the will of men .
Help me up , I feel kind of stiff '' .
It's late and you said they'd be here by dawn '' .
He whispered .
We may take her with us -- to California .
I loved my garden '' .
The wan light spread over the ground and the valley revealed in the first glimmer the contours of trees and fences and palely shadowed gullies .
`` Help me up , Clay .
Clayton tried to call back the face of the man he had known .
When they turned in the saddle they could see the men behind them , strung out on the prairie in a flat black line .
He made a fool of you , Lester '' .
I don't know yet , it's crazy ; ;
Two men , together like us , we could do somethin fine out there , maybe find a place where no one's ever been .
The two horses broke from the yard , from the circle of light cast by the lamp still burning in the house , into the darkness .
He swung round to the other men -- `` We can catch him easy ! !
He burst from the hot confinement of the room into the cold night air .
California is too far , he thought .
The silence oppressed him , made him bend low over the horse's neck as if to hide from a wind that had begun to blow far away and was twisting slowly through the darkness in its slow search .
`` Clay '' , he said , `` where are we goin '' ? ?
There was no one but me .
Clayton lifted him gently into the saddle , like a child .
He had taken a carbine down from the wall and it trailed from his hand , the stock bumping on the wood floor .
It was a fair fight , the boy provoked it -- Big Charlie told me so .
Lester's hand fluttered to Cabot's shoulder .
Lester heard their muttering , saw their eyes reveal their desire .
He fled through the door and down the steps , running , and the men grunted and followed , pushing Lester to one side where he backed against the wall with the sleeve of his jacket raised before his eyes to shut out the light .
There's someone there I have to see .
`` I loved this valley '' , he whispered huskily .
Start out fresh , the two of us , like nothin had ever happened '' .
That's what you wanted , isn't it ? ?
Thirty-five
Gavin paused wearily .
I treated them fair ''
`` You can't make me go '' .
He knew who was riding after him -- the men he had known all his life , the men who had worked for him , sworn their loyalty to him .
The eyes followed him fearfully .
`` He killed Tom -- do you understand that '' ? ?
Against that other man he could rally his anger ; ;
His wife had said to him : `` Nellie is in love with Clayton Roy .
The mare began to tire and Clayton felt the spray of snow from the hoofs of Gavin's stallion .
I don't want to leave it '' .
He was too old -- when he passed up and through the corridor of pines that lined the trail he could see ahead , he was passing from life .
`` He's not your brother , he's Gavin's son .
Gavin's face was bloodless with excitement .
First he thought of the time he had ridden to Gavin and told him how his cattle were being rustled at the far end of the valley .
He wiped his lips with a sleeve , then stared at Clayton in a childish kind of wonder .
they rode at a measured pace through the valley .
You can't '' --
A bold line of violet broke loose from the high ridge of the mountains , followed by feathers of red that swept the last stars from the sky .
