Future plans
Its editors only knew of one example to point to , a public housing development of 278 homes in New Haven described by John Schulz in the March , 1950 issue .
For example , the officials of Poughkeepsie town ( township ) where the project is located think highly of it because it simplifies their snow clearing problem .
He believes that this is a sound approach to gas competition in builder developments where gas is available .
The oilheating industry is looking up , led by a revival of research and development .
The word means it won't boil away easily , nothing else .
The earlier New Haven development was public housing , so it easily leaped over the problems met in a private venture .
When a family buys a home the title is subject to a perpetual easement to Tri-State .
Every year about this time National Gargle Your Cooling System week rolls around .
The fact is that removing and leaving out a thermostat from any water cooled vehicle , will greatly increase the fuel consumption , reduce power and contribute to spark plug fouling due to an accumulation of excessive carbon deposits on the insulators .
Does your policy have a lay-up clause ? ?
How does Tri-State get its revenue from this plan ? ?
The figure five is important in insurance .
But it's too early yet to go visit Oakwood Heights .
Duplicate coverage .
The amount paid by the oil company to Tri-State for the use of its oil distribution system and the privilege of supplying all the homes , is subject to negotiation but naturally must be profitable to both parties .
It will accommodate firing rates as low as a half gallon an hour .
This means either cars or trucks .
Be careful that you keep adequate coverage , but look for places to save money .
Rather the monthly total consumption was divided and charged on the basis of number of rooms and persons in the family .
This first test is being leased for ten years but future projects will require at least 15 years .
The meter is mounted high on the basement wall .
What does Tri-State actually want to do , now that it has the meters under franchise and certain phases of its piping system in the `` patent applied for '' stage ? ?
Not a year goes by but what several local companies in the U.S. and Canada , even overseas , write to Fueloil & Oil Heat to inquire if it's feasible and where it is being done .
Don't let your mechanics pull the thermostats out of those fueloil delivery trucks or installation rigs of yours .
Next , run the engine and let it heat up so the thermostat opens , and then look for leaks again .
For this first development the supplier signing the lease is a major oil company but in turn the deal is being transferred for operation to its local fueloil distributor .
Common complaints included `` Mrs. Murphy '' leaving her windows open all the time , a fresh air fan , or the family was visiting `` Aunt Minnie '' with the house shut up but they still paid the same rate for oil .
The big tanks were at the site but still sunning themselves .
The Government housing agencies consider it feasible with one special stipulation .
The Public Service Commission has ruled that this is not a public utility , subject to their many regulations .
This has survived the years but there has been considerable concern among the tenants over the fact that the oil was not metered .
Then fill the system and add a rust inhibitor .
Discounts run up to 2% of cost .
Ritter , the builder , is convinced that the total cost of all the heating systems plus the oil distribution system is no greater than would be gas heating systems in the houses plus their lines and meters .
First , drain that old coolant down the storm sewer .
In working out the practical legal conclusions President Waters was not thinking only of this pilot project , for it is planned to duplicate this program or system in other builder developments nationally .
For a few details of the system the lines are 1-1/4'' '' X-Tru-Coat , a product of Republic Steel Corp. , and all lines are welded .
In the present project the heating is by circulating hot water from Paragon boiler-burner units with summer-winter domestic hot water hookups .
others were building .
Initial considerations
Several financial institutions , both banks and insurance companies , have been sounded out .
He must undertake complete servicing of the oilheating equipment to assure fine heating .
Have a talk with your insurance agent .
Again , the oil man must read the meters at such intervals as he finds best .
A big mechanical ditcher was running the trenches , and the town building inspector was paying a friendly , if curious , visit .
It is always difficult , or at least time-consuming , to get approval of any kind of line under a public street , as one example .
Do it this way for the summer gargle :
There's an advantage in having a firm like Tri-State headed by a lawyer .
Now , check for leaks in your hoses and hose connections , around the freeze-out plugs , gaskets , water pump seals and heater fittings .
Avoid doubling up on the same item .
It wants to interest builders and oil companies in the idea of including its facility in their new home projects , by financing and installing the storage , piping and meters , and leasing these for 15 years , with renewal options , to a strong oil company .
They like it and would supply most of the capital because of the long term leases by strong oil companies .
If you run into excess plug fouling on one truck , check to be sure that the rig has a thermostat .
Spring and summer may be here officially , but those thermos stay in .
The officers of the new corporation have naturally explored many angles , as well as personalities that might be affected .
As a matter of fact you could probably find a new home development in every populated county in the country with three-bedroom ranch style cottages in the $14,000 range .
In other words , the whole storage and pipeline system does not belong to the homeowners nor to the town but rather to Tri-State .
The job of getting property easements and street easements and the acre for the tanks would become pretty discouraging .
Sixty miles north of New York City where the wooded hills of Dutchess County meet the broad sweep of the Hudson River there is a new home development called `` Oakwood Heights '' .
This whole development is certain to be of interest to the readers , for the idea has so often been mentioned , somewhat wistfully .
As a result of that attitude , others have been discouraged from trying central distribution .
With many company policies you get a fleet discount if you insure five or more rigs .
If a lot of rust shows in the drain , use a good flushing cleaner .
The thermostat is important to get your engine up to operating temperature quickly , and to keep it running at its most efficient temperature through the proper circulation of the coolant .
The major gets the assured gallonage for the life of the lease and the distributor apparently can do well because delivery cost is low .
Its oil for heating is metered monthly to each home from a line that starts at a central storage point .
The supplier delivers at his convenience in transport loads , so as to maintain two-to-three weeks reserve supply against weather contingencies .
There must be a restriction in the deed to provide that the customer may not be charged more than the current market price for the oil , an obvious precaution , since the account is permanently wedded , just like with gas or electricity .
Check the temperature gage and be sure it is working .
It leases the whole facility to a large oil company , at least large enough to have a strong credit position .
Only eight of the 50 houses were completed at the time of the editor's visit on June 8th ; ;
Are you paying too much for your truck insurance ? ?
Dow says that the fluid can be used now for two years .
It pays in the long ( hot ) run to take good care of the water works .
Of course , you'll want to use the softest water you can in your radiators .
A new low capacity meter is the key that unlocks the situation at Oakwood Heights .
This means that if your insured vehicle is laid up for more than 30 days , insurance can be suspended and a proportionate return of your premium made to you .
There's a good chance you are doubling on some coverage , not taking discounts coming to you and not cutting some corners that can be cut .
For the central storage , Tri-State buys one acre , Buries its tanks and simply holds permanent title to that piece .
Use the air hose for this job .
For example , don't pay in a truck policy for medical coverage that you may be paying for in a health and accident policy .
Its figures are a half inch high and very easy to read , even into tenth gallons .
For example : If your bodily injury claims start payment after the first $250 , a 25% premium saving is often made .
A primary ingredient in these fields is imagination , and Tri-State Pipeline Corporation deserves a very good mark .
The idea of a central tank with lines to each house is not in itself a novelty .
These have to do with property rights , municipal official attitudes and a host of others .
Vice-president is Louis Berkman and the secretary-treasurer is Mark Ritter .
Called a `` Slo-Flo '' meter it was designed for this job by Power Plus Industries of Los Angeles , a key individual being Don Nelson .
First go over the type of coverage you now have .
Ritter is the builder of Oakwood Heights and president of Kahler-Craft Distributors , Inc. , Newburgh , N.Y. .
It may also work in one other way -- by licensing its system patents and supplying the meters , letting the oil company or even the builder install the facilities .
Its president is Otis M. Waters , partner in the law firm of Timen & Waters , 540-K Chrysler Bldg. , New York City .
However , that is not all he has to do .
They are laid a minimum of 24'' '' deep and in some areas four feet down , particularly under roads , to stay clear of all other piping such as water and sewers and to minimize shocks from heavy trucking .
If you use one of the new year-round cooling system fluids such as `` Dowguard '' be sure to check it .
Usually premium reductions can be obtained by applying deductibles to your liability plan .
Be sure the bugs and dirt are blown out of the radiator fins .
This is a pilot operation sponsored by a new entity chartered in Delaware as the Tri-State Pipeline Corporation , with principal offices in New York State .
Tri-State has acquired its exclusive distribution for the northern , principal heating states .
Look for these features which may mean you can save :
Take precautions now , to be sure you avoid those unpleasant and costly heat breakdowns when the temperature zooms this summer .
But Oakwood Heights is unique in one particular .
But in a new development where everything starts from scratch the solutions are simple .
To overcome this , the builder lays and completes the street himself , then deeds it to the community while retaining a perpetual easement for the oil lines .
Check its inhibitor effectiveness before leaving it in during the summer .
On this first venture the central storage is 20,000 gallons , in two tanks , or an average of 400 gallons for each of the 50 homes .
Pitch it out .
The rust inhibitors in the fluid are used up after one year , and you don't want to risk the rust that two years' use could mean .
Don't save the anti-freeze , even if it the expensive `` permanent '' type .
This applies to repair work of winter storage .
It would be pretty difficult to install a Tri-State system in old neighborhoods , and that's an understatement .
The central storage is near a main artery quite easy to reach with large transports on a short crescent swing , with fewer trucks in the residential streets .
