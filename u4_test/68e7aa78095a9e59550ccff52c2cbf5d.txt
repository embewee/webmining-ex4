My man came out an hour later , drove to the beach , turned right and after half a mile went to the Swim and Tan Motel .
`` Your wife isn't going to join you -- later '' ? ?
She gave a little pout and said , `` I don't get off work until eleven o'clock .
I turned on the electric bug , and the signal came in loud and clear .
The card the man I was shadowing had filled out was still on the counter .
one here and one that's out quite a ways where there's usually curb parking '' .
I asked .
The attendant waved me on .
`` Not a bit '' , I said , `` but she's keeping her figure in hand '' .
Can you find it all right '' ? ?
I used the alias of Robert C. Richards , gave the first three letters and the first and last figure of the license number on the agency heap , but a couple of phony numbers in between .
There are three soft-drink vending machines , and if you should be joined by -- anybody -- try to keep things quiet , if you will .
You're the one I was talking to about a monthly rental .
`` No '' , I said .
`` Oh , you ! !
`` Thank you '' , I told her .
I stayed half a block behind him , letting lots of cars keep in between us , listening to the steady beep beep beep .
I made time and picked him up within ten blocks .
He didn't have to telephone .
I could get up close to him where there was traffic but had to drop far behind when there wasn't traffic .
You're conscious of the fact that your feet hurt , that the city pavements are hard .
He started to say something as I walked in and then suddenly grinned and said , `` Oh , yes .
`` Oh , that's all right '' , he said .
I noticed that he was in Unit 12 and that he had registered under the name of Oscar L. Palmer and wife , giving a San Francisco address .
Traffic was pretty heavy .
I put in new batteries so as to be certain I'd have plenty of power and on my way out walked over to the regular parking stalls and stood looking at them thoughtfully .
I waited until the parking attendant was busy with a customer , then slipped around the back of the car with license number JYM 114 , attached the electronic bug to the rear bumper and walked out .
She went in to get the hamburgers , and I switched on the device again and kept the signal from Dowling's car coming in steady and clear until I saw her starting back with the hamburgers .
If he does , it's still better than an even chance he won't notice the transposition of the numbers , and if he should notice it , the thing can be passed off as an honest mistake .
By this time it was dark .
`` Good figures should be kept in hand '' , she said , and walked away with an exaggerated wiggle .
It was a fairly modern motel with quite a bit of electrical display in front .
I was so hungry my stomach felt all lines of communication had been severed .
I waited a solid two hours before my man came out of the office building .
I wasn't far behind him when he entered the parking lot and hurried over to his car .
You see , she's on a diet .
That's when my evening commences '' .
She looked at me provocatively .
I couldn't see him , but the electric bugging device gave steady beeps when it was straight ahead , short half beeps when the car I was following was to the left , and long drawn-out beeps when it turned to the right .
`` That curb parking is undependable and annoying , particularly when it rains '' , he said .
I walked with him back to the entrance .
I have a couple of them I'm figuring on ; ;
The manager of the motel was a woman who apparently didn't care .
`` Make it as snappy as you can , will you '' ? ?
His signal was coming loud and clear and then all of a sudden it turned to a buzz .
`` You mean you're all alone , Mr. Richards '' ? ?
I didn't turn it off '' .
I was held up a bit trying to make a left turn .
`` You really in a hurry , Handsome '' ? ?
You want to sit down .
`` I'm in a hurry , Beautiful '' .
`` It's ten dollars either way .
Then I shut off the device again .
`` Diets can be terrible '' , the girl said .
`` It's one of the rules on transients .
That meant he'd parked someplace .
I reached over and switched off the electronic bugging device .
The place wasn't particularly busy at that time of night , and the girl who was waiting on me , who was clothed in the tightest-fitting pair of slacks I had ever seen on a woman and a sweater that showed everything there was -- and there was lots of it -- wanted to be sociable .
`` I'll be here at ten-fifty-five '' , I said .
I turned left too soon and got a signal showing that I was still behind him but he was to the right .
I took another sidelong glance at the other registration card , then took the key to Unit 13 that she had given me and went down long enough to park the car .
I turned on the device again , half fearful that I might find silence , but the buzzes came in loud and clear .
`` Okay '' , I said to the attendant , `` I'll let you know if I close the deal on the office in this building '' .
`` Don't you think it's selfish to have dinner before you go to pick her up '' ? ?
`` It's a sublease .
The attendant recognized me once more and said , `` What did you do about that office '' ? ?
Ninety-nine times out of a hundred the motel manager doesn't check the license number on the plates against the license number the tenant writes out .
She wanted to hang around while I was eating .
I grinned at him , handed him a couple of dollars and said , `` By the time you get the parking charge figured up , there should be a cigar in it for you '' .
`` Forgot to get something out of the car '' , I told him , showing him my ticket .
My lights would have been a giveaway if I'd tried to shadow him in the conventional manner .
I was giving the parked cars the once-over .
I sat there with the faint odor of charcoal-broiled steaks tantalizing my nostrils and occasionally catching the aroma of coffee .
My quarry was in the apartment house for two hours .
Moreover , I'd have lost him if it hadn't been for the electronic shadowing device .
Regulars drive out their own cars '' .
The powerful microphone I could press against the wall between my motel unit and that occupied by the man would bring in the sound of any conversation , and I was positively nauseated I was so hungry .
I said `` Darn it , that's the automatic signal that shows when the ignition key is on .
I know where the car is .
I kept trying to get him to take my money .
`` It's a kindness to her .
`` You're going to be a regular .
`` That's right '' , I told him .
She knew where to come .
`` Okay '' , I told him .
It's one thing to go without food when you're occupied with some work or when you're simply postponing a meal , but when you're dependent on someone else and know that you can't eat until he's bedded down for the night , hunger can be a gnawing torture .
`` That's right '' .
What's that thing going buzz-buzz-buzz in your car '' ? ?
I went back to the agency car and got out an electric bug , one of the newest devices for electronic shadowing .
The Oldsmobile with the license number JYJ 114 was in stall number five .
'' She announced .
With the aid of that I could hear my man moving around , heard him cough a couple of times , heard the toilet flush , heard the sound of water running .
After a while , however , a person's mind gets fed up and that magnifies all of the disagreeable physical symptoms which go with that sort of an assignment .
`` I'm in a rush right now .
The batteries on the bugging device I had put on the car were still fresh enough to send out good strong signals .
He came out alone .
`` I don't think so '' .
After fifteen minutes of traffic driving he turned to the left .
She asked .
You'll get in the office building here .
It's a formality , you know '' .
I asked .
There are ice cubes in a container at the far end and in another by the office .
She'll eat just a pineapple and cottage cheese salad and I'm to have one with her so she won't feel out of place '' .
I could have written anything .
The construction was reasonably solid ; ;
He gave me a ticket on the agency car and parked it .
Want me to drive it out '' ? ?
For the first fifteen or twenty minutes it's possible to be more or less interested in window displays , then in people passing by .
`` Not to you '' , she said smiling .
There's lots of time left '' .
She was complying with the law in regard to registrations but she certainly wasn't checking license numbers or bothering the tenants .
We like to run a nice quiet place '' .
You get business where the business is , not where it isn't '' .
He consulted the parking ticket , then looked at a notation and said , `` You're in the third row back toward the rear .
Whoever his companion was going to be , she was going to join him later .
I waited until my man was coming out of the office with the key to a cabin before I went in to register .
I always keep a set in the car .
I sat where I could watch the exit and realized I was hungry .
I put a small electric amplifier against the wall on the side I wanted to case .
I remembered it was the Peeping Tom place .
`` How much overweight is she '' ? ?
I circled the block and found he was in the parking lot of a high-class restaurant .
He had written out the license number of his car but had transposed the last two figures , an old dodge which is still good .
One of the hardest chores a detective has is hanging around on a city street , trying to make himself inconspicuous , keeping an eye on the entrance of an office building and waiting .
`` That's what they all say .
You don't want to lease a place way out in the sticks .
not like the cracker-box construction of so many of the motel units that have stucco all over the outside but walls that are thin enough so you can hear every movement of the people in the adjoining apartment .
After a while the signal became a buzz and I knew he was behind me .
`` If you expect her to show up '' , she said , `` you'd better put ' and wife ' on there .
I was back in ten minutes .
By the time I'd made it he was gone .
I got in the car , drove down to the drive-in and ordered a couple of hamburgers with everything included , a cup of coffee and the fastest service possible .
`` I haven't made up my mind yet '' , I said .
I found a parking place half a block away , sat in the car and waited .
Your leg muscles and back muscles feel weary .
`` I'll have one of the boys get it '' , he said .
I had noticed a drive-in down the road a quarter of a mile .
When I switched on the lights for her to come and get the check , I had the exact change plus a dollar tip .
`` There may not be any women left '' , I said .
I hurried over to the agency heap , jumped in , started the motor and was just in time to see the car I wanted to shadow turn to the left .
`` Any difference in the rate '' ? ?
`` Sure '' , I told him .
If it ever got behind me , the beep turned to a buzz .
I made a big circle until I located the car parked at the curb in front of an apartment house .
`` It's early in the evening to be in a hurry .
Then he came out and started driving toward the beach .
