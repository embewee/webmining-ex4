Mr. Balaguer is in control , and opposition leaders have no further excuse to suspect his offer of a coalition government preliminary to free elections in the spring .
The concept of labor as a special class is outmoded , and in the task confronting America as bastion of the free world , labor must learn to put the national interest first if it is itself to survive .
No betting man , Mr. Goldberg says he's merely `` putting my neck out again '' by predicting the rate will go down this month .
The 1961 feed grain program , which the secretary sponsored , has been declared a billion dollar fiasco .
He is the first top administration officer to see the bottom of the slump .
But automation and the increasing complexity of factories has renewed the competition for jobs .
Within the Organization of American States , there may be some criticism of this unilateral American intervention which was not without risk obviously .
Matter of survival

The subcommittee is not alone in questioning the effectiveness of the department .
He will need the help of all OAS members to eradicate , finally , the forces of authoritarianism , pro-Trujillo and pro-Castro alike .
Public sentiment for conserving our rich natural heritage is growing .
But Interior Secretary Udall warns that there is a race on between those who would develop our few surviving open shorelines and those who would save them for the enjoyment of all as public preserves .

The issue was sufficiently potent in 1935 to spark secession from the American Federation of Labor of its industrial union members .
The secretary based his assessment on the upturn in retail sales .
This shouldn't surprise the secretary ; ;
Anybody who is expecting a joyride should , according to Mr. Shriver , get off the train right now .
Self-criticism is a rare but needed commodity in Congress .
Perhaps , as Mr. Freeman says , American agriculture may stop the Communists , but it is also swindling the American taxpayer .
President Kennedy has indicated his dissatisfaction with its performance .
Walter Reuther , leader of the industrial union faction of the AFL-CIO , says another two years of this squabbling will be disastrous for all American labor .
This tends to create friction and confusion and has not made it easier for Secretary Rusk to restore vigor and initiative among his subordinates .
The result : $1.1 billion added to the deficit in the federal budget .
American taxpayers have been impressed by the surpluses for a long , long time .
No joyride
Mr. Balaguer's troubles are by no means over .
much of the glamor President Kennedy's Peace Corps may have held for some prospective applicants has been removed by Sargent Shriver , the head corpsman .
But so convinced of communism's inevitable triumph is Prince Sihanouk that he is ready to throw in the towel .
It will be a 16-hour training day .
But competent observers believe he is making progress , particularly toward what Sen. Jackson lists as the primary need -- `` a clearer understanding of where our vital national interests lie and what we must do to promote them '' .
forecasting economic activity is a hazardous undertaking even for the specialist .
In New Jersey , too
The odds thus appear favorable that the secretary's neck may be spared .
If the Dominican Republic achieves free , democratic government , it will be due in large part to the U.S. show of force that enabled President Balaguer to prevent a threatened restoration of Trujillo dictatorship .
But there was no complaint from the Dominican crowds which lined Ciudad Trujillo's waterfront shouting , `` Vive Yankees '' ! !
February's volume was 1 per cent above January's for the first pickup since last October , although it's still 1.5 per cent off from February 1960 .
The move for establishment of a national seashore park on 30,000 acres of Cape Cod , from Provincetown to Chatham , is strengthened by President Kennedy's interest in that area .
But the farmers outsmarted Washington by shortening the distance between the rows and pouring on the fertilizer .
But that heritage is shrinking even faster .
And now Mr. Hodges has pioneered further into the economic unknown with the announcement that he thinks business has stopped sliding and that it should start going upward from this point .
Commerce Secretary Hodges seems to have been cast in the role of pacemaker for official Washington's economic forecasters .
A senate subcommittee headed by Sen. Jackson of Washington has been going over the State Department and has reached some predictable conclusions .
Help when needed
Against the dramatic fight being waged for preservation of 30 miles of Cape Cod shoreline , the tiny tract at Stone Harbor may seem unimportant .
Outwardly , Ciudad Trujillo is calm .
And the pay , of course , will be nil .
Mr. Freeman said that in many of the countries he visited on a recent world trade trip people were more awed by America's capacity to produce food surpluses than by our industrial production -- or even by the Soviet's successes in space .
What's wrong at state
Betting men
The economy seems to be sailing along on an even keel and the 1961 hurricane season and auto strikes are at an end so they can't be blamed in November .
Mr. Rusk should also draw comfort from Sen. Jackson's recommendation that congressional methods of dealing with national security problems be improved .
Corroborating Mr. Hodges' figures was the Federal Reserve Board's report of the large sales increase in the nation's department stores for the week ending March 4 .

Mr. Goldberg has less reason for missing .
And thus far , Mr. Freeman has offered very little relief .

The department needs a clearer `` sense of direction '' at the top and it needs fewer , but better , people , Sen. Jackson says .
In fact , over the years , the American farmer's capacity to over-produce has cost the taxpayers a large dollar .
Prince Sihanouk's powers of prognostication some day may be confirmed but history is not likely to praise the courage of his convictions .
His successor , Secretary Goldberg , also has been guessing wrong on a drop in the unemployment rate which has been holding just under 7 per cent for the last 11 months .
Whether it could be as disastrous for American labor as , say , Jimmy Hoffa of the Teamsters , is a matter of conjecture .

Mr. Mitchell had an excuse for losing -- the steel strike lasted much longer than he anticipated .
the Army , Navy and Air Force , among others , may question Secretary Freeman's claim that the high estate of United States agriculture is the `` strongest deterrent '' to the spread of communism .

The desirability of preserving such places as the Cape dunes and Stone Harbor sanctuary becomes more apparent every year .
Now the Stone Harbor bird sanctuary , 31 acres of magic attraction for exotic herons , is threatened , but the battlefront extends far beyond our state .
More , the U.S. action was hailed by a principal opposition leader , Dr. Juan Bosch , as having saved `` many lives and many troubles in the near future '' .
those watching the growing rivalry between craft unions and industrial unions may recognize all the pressures that led to the big labor split in 1935 .
By comparison , Stone Harbor bird sanctuary's allies seem less formidable , for aside from the Audubon Society , they are mostly the snowy , common and cattle egrets and the Louisiana , green , little blue and black-crowned herons who nest and feed there .

That breach was healed 20 years later by merger of the American Federation of Labor and the Congress of Industrial Organizations .
James P. Mitchell , when he was the head of the department , promised to eat his hat if unemployment didn't drop below three million a couple of years ago .
Little resistance
In cooperating toward that objective , OAS might move with the speed and effectiveness demonstrated by the United States .
`` I have to see the facts '' , is the way the prince puts it .
Nor does Sen. Jackson discuss the delicate situation created by the presence in the White House of a corps of presidential assistants engaged in the study of foreign policy .
None of the Trujillo family remains .
He lost , but settled for a cake in the shape of a fedora .
