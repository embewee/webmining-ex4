Was it supposed , perchance , that A & M ( vocational training , that is ) was quite sufficient for the immigrant class which flooded that part of the New England world in the post-Civil War period , the immigrants having been brought in from Southern Europe , to work in the mills , to make up for the labor shortage caused by migration to the West ? ?
There is a legend ( Hawthorne records it in his `` English Notebooks '' .
Southern Liberals ( there are a good many ) -- especially if they're rich -- often exhibit blithe insouciance .
) and was repealed .
I was having lunch not long ago ( apologies to N. V. Peale ) with three distinguished historians ( one specializing in the European Middle Ages , one in American history , and one in the Far East ) , and I asked them if they could name instances where the general mores had been radically changed with `` deliberate speed , majestic instancy '' ( Francis Thompson's words for the Hound Of Heaven's Pursuit ) by judicial fiat .
It ignores the sordid financial aspects ( quite conveniently , too , for his audience , who could indulge in moral indignation without visible , or even conscious , discomfort , their money from the transaction having been put away long ago in a good antiseptic brokerage ) .
That the Court order does not unequally affect the Southern region ? ?
Who will say that our country is even now a homogeneous community ? ?

Mr. Justice Taney's Dred Scott decision in 1857 was unpopular in the North , and soon became a dead letter .
But I think that something more than this is involved .
I don't propose to go into their history , but I have one or two surmises .
The phrase `` consent of the governed '' needs a hard look .
For over a hundred years Southerners have felt that the North was picking on them .
To guard against the tyranny of a numerical majority , Calhoun developed his theory of `` concurrent majority '' , which , he said , `` by giving to each portion of the community which may be unequally affected by the action of government , a negative on the others , prevents all partial or local legislation '' .
Like Pilate , they had washed their hands .
A Yale historian , writing a few years ago in The Yale Review , said : `` We in New England have long since segregated our children '' .

He seemed a little surprised that it should have caused any particular trouble anywhere .
Circumstances alter cases .
In the pre-Civil War years , the South argued that the slave was not less humanely treated than the factory worker of the North .
Lincoln understood this better than most when he said in his `` Second Inaugural '' that God `` gives to both North and South this terrible war , as the woe due to those by whom the offense came '' .
I must confess that I prefer the Liberal who is personally affected , who is willing to send his own children to a mixed school as proof of his faith .
There one finds concentrated in a comparatively small area the chief universities , colleges , and preparatory schools of the United States .
After how many generations is such wealth ( mounting all the while through the manipulations of high finance ) purified of taint ? ?

for though their people had very few slaves themselves , yet they had been pretty considerable carriers of them to others '' .
New England academies welcome fugitives from the provinces , South as well as West .
How do we define it '' ? ?
