Checkit ( Faber Hanover-Supermarket ) 2:35 ; ;
Custom Maid ( Knight Dream-Way Dream ) 2:34.2 ; ;
Good Flying ( Good Time-Olivette Hanover ) 2:36 ; ;
She hesitated , she hopped , she rolled and rocked , skipped and jumped , but in some two weeks she started to pace , From that time to this she has shown steady improvement and now looks like one of the classiest things on the grounds .
They are two good colts of different type .
While 2-year-olds are still gaining most of the attention at the track , green horses are starting to go a bit , and Jimmy Cruise has several that can really make it .
on Jan. 21 , , 2:36 .
Cathy J. Hanover ( Tar Heel-Kaola Hanover ) , formerly called Karet Hanover , has been rather a problem child , but is getting better all the while and can pace a twice around in about 2:31 .

In going away Debonnie got behind several lengths , stalling at the start -- she is a little fussy .
Premium Freight ( Titan Hanover-Pebble Hanover ) , 2:30.3-35.3 ; ;
This filly is a much better individual than either of her full-sisters , Valentine Day and Cerise -- more scale and much better underpinning .
Faber's Kathy ( Faber Hanover-Ceyway ) 2:37 ; ;
-- After 52 rainless days , moisture finally came to Del Mar , resulting in but one workout during the week for most of the horses , and leaving us with less than half our total average rainfall during the season .
This colt arrived at the Raceway early last November , and immediately was put into harness and line-driven for a few days , and then put to cart and broken in very nicely , knowing nothing but trot .

Lena Faber ( Faber Hanover-Chalidale Lena ) 2:33 ; ;
Thor Hanover ( Adios-Trustful Hanover ) is a wonderful looking prospect and another good individual , with solid , rugged conformation , good , flat bone and excellent feet .
She was then trained on the trot until December 29 , hitched to a breaking cart once around the half-mile track and hoppled again .
This colt is behind most of the other 2-year-olds in the Simpson stable but can show about as much pace as any of them .
His best mile to date is 2:28-:33 .
His best mile to date is 2:32.2 .
Faber's Choice ( Faber Hanover-Sally Joe Whippet ) 2:36 ; ;

Majestic Pick comes next , with a mile in 2:30-:33.2 .
Marquis Pick ( Gene Abbe-Direct Grattan ) seems to be the pick of the stable at the present time .

After well broken and equipped with 12-oz. shoes on behind , bare-footed in front , she would trot a real storm with the master , Delvin , driving .

Step Aside ( Direct Rhythm-Wily Widow ) has worked in 2:32 on the half-mile track and shows promise .
I have just seen Debonnie and Prompt Time work a mile in 2:34 , last quarter in :35.3 .

Being blistered for curbs has delayed his work somewhat .
Maria Key , 2 , 2:06 looked great in 2:22 ; ;
First Flyer ( Frisco Flyer-Castle Light ) looks like a splendid candidate for the Illinois Stakes .
Blistered for curbs and laid off three weeks , he is coming along fine and looks like a pacer to me .
Lorena Gallon ( Bill Gallon-Loren Hanover ) , 2:30-:34.3 ; ;
Monel shows improvement with each work-out and looks the makings of a good brood mare after winning her share of races .
Then , after emasculation , he was eased up for a couple of weeks .
He also likes Hampton Hanover ( Titan Hanover-Bertie Hanover ) 2:37 .
She is more like her full brother , Taraday Hanover , but larger .
The colts in Simpson's stable have little if anything on the fillies , especially the pacers .
This filly is another Adios that wants to trot , and trot she did until forced to do otherwise .
Laguerre Hanover is outstanding in type and conformation -- good body , plenty of heart girth , stands straight on his legs on excellent feet -- and has the smoothest gait .
This time she submitted and in a few days was going good .
Isaac ( Hoot Mon-Goddess Hanover ) , 2:30.3-:36 ; ;

Fury Hanover ( Hoot Mon-Fay ) , 2:30.3-:36 ; ;
It took this colt several weeks to strike a pace .
Staley Hanover ( Knight Dream-Sweetmite Hanover ) is a little on the small side but a very compact colt and looks like one to stand training and many future battles with colts in his class .
The last-named is a fine-looking , large colt , who has been unfortunate to be laid off for some time due to injuries .
the crupper under his tail seemed to be old stuff .
Torrid Adios ( Torrid-Adios Molly ) is not so masculine as most of the colts , but I like his type and he certainly is one of the best-gaited pacers on the grounds .
He appeared in the hopples about November 14 , was treated for worms on the 18th , the latter date being the first time he struck a real pace .
on Jan. 18 2:37.3--:36.1 ; ;

Iosola Hanover ( Kimberly Kid-Isoletta Hanover ) 2:36 .
Sam Caton's Butterwyn ( Scotch Victor-Butler Wyn ) , a light bay filly , knows nothing but trot and has worked on the half-mile in 2:30-:36 .
