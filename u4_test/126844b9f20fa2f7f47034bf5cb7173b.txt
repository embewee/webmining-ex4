We know that in the C-plane both C and Af are analytic .
For any such square the middle corner of these will be called the vertex of the square and the corner not on the curve will be called the diagonal point of the square .
We consider now the graph of the function f{t} on Af .
Suppose Af crosses C when Af .
The values Af are the ordinary values at Af of a multi-valued function g{t} which has components corresponding to those of f{t} .
The arc is itself a segment of an analytic curve .
otherwise by Lemma 1 the component would extend beyond these points .
As S varies from zero to T , the values of S for which Af and Af cross C will be denoted by Af and Af respectively .
Thus if E is sufficiently small , there can be only one intersection of C and Af near Q , for if there were more than one intersection for every E then the difference between C and Af near Q would not be a monotone function .
A square inscribed in a curve C means a square with its four corner points on the curve , though it may not lie entirely in the interior of C .
A tangent point Q in the C-plane occurs when C and Af are tangent to one another .
There are three possibilities : ( A ) Af remains tangent to C as it is translated ; ;
We define these values as Af , and define g{t} in the same way for each T .
We now have certain squares with three corners on C .
In the third category the function is double-valued in this interval .
In some neighborhood of an isolated tangent point in the f-plane , say Af , the function Af is either double-valued or has no values defined , except at the tangent point itself , where it is single-valued .
This theorem is similar to the theorem of Kakutani that there exists a circumscribing cube around any closed , bounded convex set in Af .
Any other point of intersection between C and Af will be called a tangent point .
We will denote the values of f{t} on different components by Af .
Thus Af is also continuous at Af , and in a neighborhood of Af which does not contain a tangent point .
Suppose Af is defined in the sub-interval Af .
Proof .
But this is a contradiction , for we know that the multiplicity of f{t} is odd for every T .
We first show that the function is single-valued in some neighborhood .
The same remarks apply to an interval on the other side of Af .
This set must consist of isolated points and closed intervals .
Lemma 2 .
Each point on C , as a vertex , may possess a finite number of corresponding diagonal points by the above construction .
The latter theorem has been generalized by Yamabe and Yujobo , and Cairns to show that in Af there are families of such cubes .
We will refer to the plane of C and Af as the C-plane and to the plane of the graph as the Aj .
Proof .
We first define a function b{t} as follows : given the set of squares such that each has three corners on C and vertex at t , b{t} is the corresponding set of positive parametric differences between T and the backward corner points .
In the C-plane we construct a set of rectangular Cartesian coordinates u , V with the origin at Q and such that both C and Af have finite slope at Q .
As S increases we consider the two free corner points of the square , Af and Af , adjacent to P and Q respectively .
As S approaches T the square will be outside C and therefore both Af and Af must cross C an odd number of times as S varies from zero to T .
Furthermore , one can find a neighborhood of Q in which the difference function is monotone , for since it is analytic it can have only a finite number of extrema in any interval .
In the f-plane the coordinates of the corresponding point are Af .
This is true of all components which have such a bounded support .
We must now show that on some component of the graph there exist two points for which the corresponding diagonal points in the C-plane are on opposite sides of C .
We have Af , plus tangent points .
Now with P fixed at Af , Af-values occur when the corner Af crosses C , and are among the values of S such that Af .
Now Af and Af must both be tangent points on the T component in the f-plane ; ;
The set of intersections of Af , the rotated curve , with the original curve C consists of just the set of forward corner points on C corresponding to the vertex at Af , plus the vertex itself .
Lemma 1 .
We suppose not .
Again , the analyticity of the two curves guarantees that such intervals exist .
Here , for the case of squares inscribed in plane curves , we remove the restriction to convexity and give certain other results .
Therefore , for any value of T the number of values of f{t} is equal to the ( finite ) number of tangent points corresponding to the argument T plus an odd number .
The remaining ( incomplete ) components all have an even number of ordinary points at any argument , and are defined only on a proper sub-interval of Aj .
Now , to find Af , one needs the intersection of C and Af near Q .
The graph , as a set , may have a finite number of components .
With each vertex we associate certain numerical values , namely the set of positive differences in the parameter T between the vertex and its corresponding forward corner points .
It is also seen that Af , since the change from Af to Af is accomplished by a continuous translation .
We erect a square with PQ as a side and with free corners Af and Af adjacent to P and Q respectively .
In some neighborhood in the f-plane of any ordinary point of the graph , the function f is a single-valued , continuous function .
Then every component of the graph of F must be defined over a bounded sub-interval .
This prevents the occurrence of an infinite sequence of isolated tangent points .
Proof
In the following paper it is shown that in a certain definite sense , exactly an odd number of squares can be inscribed in every such curve which does not contain an infinite number of inscribed squares .
With the above results we can make the following remarks about the graph of F .
We turn now to the set of tangent points on the graph .
Further , we see by Lemma 2 that the multiplicity of F can only change at a tangent point , and at such a point can only change by an even integer .
We again consider a fixed point P at Af and a variable point Q at Af on C .
First , for any value of T for which all values of f{t} are ordinary points the number of values of f{t} must be odd .
There must be an odd number of such components , which will be called complete components .
We note that two such curves C and Af , cannot coincide at more than a finite number of points ; ;
Therefore , Af is single-valued near Q .
These s-values are just the ordinary values of Af .
The function f{t} defined in this way is multi-valued .
Lemma 3 .
The functions F and B have exactly the same multiplicity at every argument T .
There are two types of such intersections , depending essentially on whether the curves cross at the point of intersection .
Consider a simple , closed , plane curve C which is a real-analytic image of the unit circle , and which is given by Af .
Indeed , the spiral Af , with the two endpoints connected by a straight line possesses only one inscribed square .
The square has one corner point on the straight line segment , and does not lie entirely in the interior .
Definition .
( B ) Af moves away from C and does not intersect it at all for Af ; ;
To each paired vertex and diagonal point there corresponds a unique forward corner point , i.e. , the corner on C reached first by proceeding along C from the vertex in the direction of increasing T .
Lemma 4 .
otherwise , being analytic , they would coincide at all points , which is impossible since they do not coincide near Af .
Proof .
In a neighborhood of Q the difference between these functions is also a single-valued , analytic function of U .
This terminology will also be applied to the corresponding points in the Aj .
( C ) Af cuts across C and there are two ordinary intersections for every T in Af .
In the neighborhood of an end point of an interval of tangent points in the f-plane the function is two-valued or no-valued on one side , and is a single-valued function consisting entirely of tangent points on the other side .
These are real analytic periodic functions with period T .
Thus we obtain g{t} by introducing an oblique g{t}-axis in the Aj .
An ordinary point will be any point of intersection A such that in every neighborhood of A in the C-plane , Af meets both the interior and the exterior of C .
For it is clear that the total number of ordinary intersections of C and Af must be even ( otherwise , starting in the interior of C , Af could not finally return to the interior ) , and the center of rotation at T is the argument of the function , not a value .
The number of ordinary values of the function f{t} at T will be called its multiplicity at T .
For the vertex at Af , these values will be denoted by Af .
Each point with abscissa T on the graph represents an intersection between C and Af .
We can now prove several lemmas .
The roots of this equation are just the ordinates of the intersections of the graph of B with a straight line of unit slope through Af in the b-plane ( the plane of the graph of b ) .
The points may also touch C without crossing .
Thus the multiplicity of Af for a given T must be an even number .
But Af is just the curve Af translated without rotation through a small arc , for Af is always obtained by rotating C through exactly 90-degrees .
On C , from the point P at Af to the point Q at Af , we construct the chord , and upon the chord as a side erect a square in such a way that as S approaches zero the square is inside C .
In the second category the function Af has no values defined in a neighborhood Af .
We have shown that the graph of F contains at least one component whose inverse is the entire interval {0,T} , and whose multiplicity is odd .
A continuous change in T through an amount E results in a translation along an analytic arc of the curve Af .
The first possibility results in a closed interval of tangent points in the f-plane , the end points of which fall into category ( B ) or ( C ) .
Near Q , both curves can be represented by analytic functions of U .
The graph of f has at least one component whose support is the entire interval Aj .
With the vertex at Af in the C-plane we assume that Af is the parametric location on C of an ordinary intersection Q between C and Af .
The fact that there can not be any limit points of the set except in closed intervals follows from the argument used in Lemma 1 , namely , that near any tangent point in the C-plane the curves C and Af are analytic , and therefore the difference between them must be a monotone function in some neighborhood on either side of the tangent point .
If the vertex is at Af , and if the interior of C is on the left as one moves in the direction of increasing t , then every such corner can be found from the curve obtained by rotating C clockwise through 90-degrees about the vertex .
