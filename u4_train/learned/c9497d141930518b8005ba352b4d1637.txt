Hence , the description of each text occurrence can be retrieved by reading the list of text-ordered information-cell addresses and outputting the description indicated by the information cell for each occurrence .
A third cell can be added by storing the address of another Y-cell in Af ; ;
The cell Af becomes the second information cell in the chain and is assigned as the information cell of Af .
A description of this process will serve to illustrate how any type of information can be retrieved from the dictionary and attached to each text occurrence .
A random address Af that lies within the X-region of memory mentioned earlier is computed from the i-th dictionary form .
Each entry that is selected for storage is written into the next available cells of the Aj .
When this situation exists , the address Af will equal Af which was produced from Af .
The address Af is stored in the cell Af .
The dictionary is a form dictionary , at least in the sense that complete forms are used as the basis for matching text occurrences with dictionary entries .
) When the complete file has been read , the grammatical descriptions for all text forms found in the dictionary have been stored in the W-region ; ;
When irregularity and variation prevent summarizing , information is written in complete detail .
A random-storage scheme , based on the spelling of forms , provides an economical way to compile this text-form list .
When , as in this case , the two forms match , the address Af is saved to represent the occurrence Af .
Let Af denote the form of Af .
These two pieces of information for each dictionary form that is matched by a text form constitute the table of dictionary usage .
Each information cell in the chain contains the address of the Y-cell where the form to which it is assigned is stored .
The many linguistic techniques for reducing the amount of dictionary information that have been proposed all organize the dictionary's contents around prefixes , stems , suffixes , etc. .
occurrence -- an instance of a form in text .
Equivalents could be assigned to the paradigm either at the time it is added to the dictionary or after the word has been studied in context .
Dictionary forms found to match forms in the text list are marked .
This approach requires that : ( 1 ) each text word be separated into smaller elements to establish a correspondence between the occurrence and dictionary entries , and ( 2 ) the information retrieved from several entries in the dictionary be synthesized into a description of the particular word .
Applying the techniques developed at Harvard for generating a paradigm from a representative form and its classification , we can add all forms of a word to the dictionary at once .
If cell Af has not previously been assigned as the information cell of a form in the text-form list , it is now assigned as the information cell of Af .
The dictionary form is compared with each of these text forms .
The latter is useful for modifying information about some or all forms of a word , hence reducing the work required to improve dictionary contents .
We propose a method for selecting only dictionary information required by the text being translated and a means for passing the information directly to the occurrences in text .
The only requirements on dictionary information made by the text-lookup operation are that each form represented by the dictionary be available for lookup in the text-form list and that information for each form be available in a sequence identical with the sequence of the forms .
The appropriate action for handling these forms can be taken at that time .
Also , the dictionary is divided into at least two parts : the list of dictionary forms and the file of information that pertains to these forms .
We suggest the application of certain data-processing techniques as a solution to the problem .
The logical scheme used to accomplish the former influences the placement of information in the dictionary file .
When a match is found , an entry is made in the table of dictionary usage .
Each dictionary form is looked up in the text-form list by the same method used to look up a new text occurrence in the form list during text reading .
A significant reduction in the voume of store information is thus realized , especially for a highly inflected language such as Russian .
But first , we must define two terms so that their meaning will be clearly understood : form -- any unique sequence of alphabetic characters that can appear in a language preceded and followed by a space ; ;
( Indeed , the set of endings can be replaced by the name of a set of endings .
Text reading continues with the next occurrence .
When the information cell for Af has been determined , it is saved as a representation of Af .
An extension of the principle would permit entering a grammatical description of each form .
Text reading continues with the next occurrence .
Implementation of the latter requires storage of information needed only for synthesis .
Two very useful ways for modifying a form-dictionary are the addition to the dictionary of complete paradigms rather than single forms and the application of a single change to more than one dictionary form .
Finally , information is retrieved from the dictionary as required by stages of the translation process -- the grammatical description for sentence-structure determination , equivalent-choice information for semantic analysis , and target-language equivalents for output construction .
similarly , as many cells are added as are required .
The grammatical description of each occurrence in the text must be retrieved from the dictionary to permit such an analysis .
The final step merely uses the table of dictionary usage to select the dictionary information that pertains to each form matched in the text-form list , and uses the list of information cells recorded in text order to attach the appropriate information to each occurrence in text .
) The full forms can be derived from such information just prior to the lookup of the form in the text-form list .
If cell Af is an information cell , it and any information cells in the Y-region that have been linked to Af each contain an address in the W-region where a potentially matching form is stored .
dictionary information about the form stored at this location can be retrieved directly by occurrences of the form in text .
The first is compiling a list of text forms , assigning an information cell to each , and replacing text occurrences with the information cell assigned to the form of each occurrence .
Only the assignment of the information cells is important .
The former is intended to decrease the amount of work necessary to extend dictionary coverage .
The form itself is stored in the next available cells of the W-region , beginning in cell Af .
the information cell assigned to each text form contains the address of the grammatical description of the form it represents .
The order is identical to the ordering of the forms they describe .
The grammatical descriptions of all forms in the dictionary are recorded in a separate part of the dictionary file .
For English the reduction in size is less striking .
Entries are summarized only when by doing so the amount of information retained in the dictionary is reduced and the time required for dictionary operations is decreased .
Hence , when the address Af is computed from Af , the cell Af and all Y-cells in its chain must be inspected to determine whether Af is already in the form list or whether it should be added to the form list and the chain .
Text lookup , as we will describe it , consists of three steps .
Similarly , if the equivalents for the forms of a word do not vary , the equivalents need be entered only once with an indication that they apply to each form .
The address Af and the number of cells required to store the form are written in Af ; ;
If each text form is marked when matched with a dictionary form , the text forms not contained in the dictionary can be identified when all dictionary forms have been read .
These two steps essentially complete the lookup operation .
A third situation is possible .
the absence of such a link in the last cell indicates the end of the chain .
When an occurrence Af is isolated during text reading , a random memory address Af , the address of a cell in the X-region , is computed from the form of Af .
The address of the first cell and the number of cells used is written in the information cell for the form .
( The address of the information cell is also supplied by the table of dictionary usage .
the information cell Af is saved to represent the text occurrence .
Text reading is terminated when a pre-determined number of forms have been stored in the text-form list .
This leaves the ordering of entries variable .
For example , the inflected forms of a word can be represented , insofar as regular inflection allows , by a stem and a set of endings to be attached .
The formula for computing random addresses from the form of each occurrence will not give a distinct address for each distinct form .
Each form represented by the dictionary is looked up in the text-form list .
Each time a dictionary form matches a text form , the information cell of the matching text form is saved .
Thus , when more than one distinct form leads to a particular cell in the X-region , a chain of information cells must be created to accommodate the forms , one cell in the chain for each form .
For this step the computer memory is separated into three regions : cells in the W-region are used for storage of the forms in the text-form list ; ;
Each cell except the last in the chain also contains the address of the Y-cell that is the next element of the chain ; ;
This selection-rejection process takes place as the file is read .
When entries are being retrieved from this file , the table of dictionary usage indicates which entries to skip and which entries to store in the computer .
Text reading continues with the next occurrence .
)
If cell Af is not an information cell we conclude that the i-th dictionary form is not in the text list .
Thus , one can think of a dictionary entry as a word rather than a form .
If all forms of a paradigm are grouped together within the dictionary , a considerable reduction in the amount of information required is possible .
The list of text forms in the W-region of memory and the contents of the information cells in the X and Y-regions are no longer required .
cells in the X-region and Y region are reserved as information cells for text forms .
If Af leads to an address Af that is equal to the address computed from Af , even though Af does not match Af , the chain of information cells is extended from Af by storing the address of the next available cell in the Y-region , Af , in Af .
This initiates the second step of glossary lookup -- connecting the information cell of forms in the text-form list to dictionary forms .
( Here an entry is a form plus the information that pertains to it .
We accomplish this by compiling a list of text forms as text is read by the computer .
The first stage of translation after glossary lookup is structural analysis of the input text .
Let us assume that Af is identical to the form of an occurrence Af which preceded Af in the text .
The dictionary system is in no way dependent upon such summarization or designed around it .
If Af was assigned as the information cell for Af , the routine can detect that Af is identical to Af by comparing Af with the form stored at location Af .
The number of dictionary forms skipped since the last one matched is also saved .
A location in the computer store is also named for each marked form ; ;
A more detailed description of dictionary operations -- text lookup and dictionary modification -- gives a clearer picture .
